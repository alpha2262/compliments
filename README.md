When you visit the root ("/") of your app, it should display a generic greeting and a randomly chosen compliment. The background color of the app should be randomized as well.


When you visit "/name" (ie: "/randy"), the greeting should personalize itself to the provided name. There should still be a random compliment and background color.

Allow a user to add to the list of compliments using a POST request. You can submit POST requests to the app using Postman or a form.
How/where would you store these compliments?
